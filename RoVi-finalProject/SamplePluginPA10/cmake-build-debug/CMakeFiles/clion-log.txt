CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:43 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindRobWork.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "RobWork", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "RobWork" with any
  of the following names:

    RobWorkConfig.cmake
    robwork-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "RobWork" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "RobWork_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "RobWork" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
